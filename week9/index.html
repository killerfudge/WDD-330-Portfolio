    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>
        BOM stands for the Browser Object Model, which is a collection of properties and methods significant to the
        browser and computer screen. These properties are accessed through the window object, used within the browser
        environment
    </p>
    <p>
        global variables become a part of the global object. in the cause of the BOM this is the window object. global
        variables should typically still be referred to without referencing the global object
    </p>
    <p>
        the window object provides several properties that can provide access to information about the user, such as the
        navigator property that contains the userAgent reference to the browser being used. This one is not always
        accurate, as it can be modified to appear to be a different browser
    </p>
    <p>
        href property of window.location provides the full url of the current page, and can be changed by assignment to
        redirect the page
    </p>
    <p>
        hostname property of window.location gives the domain of the current url, while pathname gives the path that
        follows the domain
    </p>
    <p>search property returns a query string</p>
    <p>window.history provides access to pages previously visited during the current browser session.</p>
    <p>window.screen provides information of the screen the browser is displayed on.</p>
    <p>availHeight and availWidth give the height and width of the screen not taken by operating system menus</p>
    <p>
        document.cookie is a special string that simply adds to the end when you assign a new value to it, instead of
        replacing what was already there. it uses a name paired with a value, and information can be changed by setting
        the same name to a different value
    </p>
    <p>
        by default, cookies are deleted once a browser session is finished. it can be made persistent by adding ‘;
        expires=date’ at the end of the cookie, with date being UTC string format dd-mon-yyyy hh:mm:ss
    </p>
    <p>the data attribute allows the programmer to create custom attributes unique to that particular page</p>
    <p>
        data attributes must start with ‘data-‘, contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons, or
        underscores, and include an optional string value
    </p>
    <p>any attributes created using the data attribute are accessed with the dataset property</p>
    <p>saving a value to local storage creates a storage event</p>
    <p>workers can be created to allow background threads to work, though they are not usable in Chrome</p>
    <p>
        websockets allow two-wo communication with a server, allowing the connection to remain open after a request is
        made, and the response to be sent whenever it is ready without requiring multiple requests
