    <h1>Important New Functions</h1>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>hasOwnProperty(), keys(), values(), entries()</p>
    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <p>parse(), stringify()</p>
    <h2>Math</h2>
    <p>ceil(), floor(), round(), trunc(), cbrt(), hypot()</p>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
        document.body, .nodeType, .nodeName, document.images, document.anchors, document.links, document.forms,
        document.getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), document.querySelectorAll(), classList.add(),
        classList.remove(), classList.toggle(), classList.contains(), document.createElement(),
        document.createTextNode(), appendChild(), insertBefore(), removeChild(), replaceChild(), .style.display,
        addEventListener(), removeEventListener(), preventDefault(), event.stopPropagation()

    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>When reverencing a variable contained within an object, using the ‘this’ keyword is more reliable</p>
    <p>
        ‘this’ is evaluated during runtime and depends on the current context, so a function using ‘this’ can be used
        by multiple objects – “if obj.f() is called, then this is obj during the call of f”
    </p>
    <p>arrow functions do not have their own ‘this’ and so use the ‘this’ from the outer context</p>
    <p>
        variables within objects are defined as key: value pairs, with comma separations, instead of variable = value
        like I am used to
    </p>
    <p>All objects are able to be modified while the program is running, even if declared using ‘const’</p>
    <p>objects are assigned to variables with everything contained within ‘{}’ after the ‘='</p>
    <p>if the property key is the same as the variable name that goes with it, then you can just include the name</p>
    <p>
        while dot notation is more common to access the values within an object, you can also use a string form of the
        name within []. this allows you to evaluate an expression and use it as a property key, and nonstandard property
        and method names require this notation
    </p>
    <p>the value of a property is allowed to be a JavaScript expression</p>
    <p>Symbol objects can be used as keys by enclosing the Symbol’s name in []</p>
    <p>objects can contain other objects</p>
    <p>all objects are assigned by reference</p>
    <p>object literals can be parameters for functions, allowing the parameters to be passed by name and in any order</p>
    <p>the DOM represents a html document as a grouping of nodes laid out in a tree</p>
    <p>the DOM treats whitespace between tags as a node</p>
    <p>
        when interacting with CSS using the DOM, any CSS property names separated with a ‘-‘ are instead written in
        camelCase
    </p>
    <p>
        the recommended way to handle events is to use event listeners. Inline event handlers are not recommended since
        they mix the JavaScript with the markup
    </p>
    <p>
        functions are not followed by () when inside the argument for event listeners, as that would cause the function
        to be called when the listener is created, instead of when the event happens
    </p>
    <p>the function used in an event listener needs to be named in order to remove it</p>
    <p>
        clicking on one element means that you are also clicking on all elements that contain that element, such as the
        list that contains an item clicked, or the overall body and html tags. As event move through the different tags,
        they are said to propagate, with bubbling referring to going from child to parent, and capturing from parent to
        child. bubbling is the default
