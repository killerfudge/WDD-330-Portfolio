    <h1>Important New Functions</h1>
    <h2>form</h2>
    <p>.elements, reset()</p>
    <h2>object</h2>
    <p>
        getPrototypeOf(), isPrototypeOf(), hasOwnProperty(), propertyIsEnumerable(), getOwnPropertyDescriptor(),
        defineProperty(), create(), assign(), mixin()
    </p>
    <h2>functions</h2>
    <p>call()</p>
    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>
        use document.forms to collect all the form in the document. Even if there is only one form, it will still be a
        collection and require index notation.
    </p>
    <p>
        while the submit() function can be used, button and input elements with the type ‘submit’ and inputs with the
        type ‘image’ can also be used to manually submit
    </p>
    <p>buttons with type ‘reset’ will do the same as the function, though they are considered poor usability</p>
    <p>
        certain events are specific to forms, such as the focus event, which is activated whenever the cursor is placed
        inside the element, and the blur event, which is activated when the cursor leaves the element
    </p>
    <p>the change event happens when the cursor leaves an element after it has been changed.</p>
    <p>
        a submit event can be used to intercept a form before the normal submission takes place, allowing it to be
        interacted with
    </p>
    <p>
        different types of input elements: text(default), password, checkbox, radio button, hidden, file, and additional
        elements that have been added and are becoming supported
    </p>
    <p>
        while putting type=’text’ for a text input is not necessary, it helps make the purpose of the input clear and is
        therefore recommended
    </p>
    <p>giving more than one element the same name property allows them to be accessed as a collection</p>
    <p>if a browser does not support a new input element then it will be displayed as a normal input</p>
    <p>
        it is recommended to validate form both client side and server side, as the JavaScript code can be altered and
        the client side can even be skipped entirely
    </p>
    <p>though HTML5 has its own validation API, not all browsers support it</p>
    <p>JavaScript allows OOP through objects, referred to as prototype-based, but also includes classes</p>
    <p>
        entering only one parameter into the Array constructor set the length property of the array to that parameter
        and is full of undefined
    </p>
    <p>
        the constructor property can be used to create a copy of an object even when it is unknown what the name of the
        constructor was
    </p>
    <p>
        the static keyword before a function name makes it so that only the class can call that function, not the
        objects created from the class
    </p>
    <p>
        the prototype property allows creation of an object that all shares all properties with all instances of the
        class or constructor function it came from, effectively allowing manipulation of a class after it has been
        created
    </p>
    <p>arrays and objects should never be created inside a prototype</p>
    <p>
        to make something within a class private, simply declare it like normal instead of using this.propertyName =
        propertyValue
    </p>
    <p>
        non-enumerable properties will not appear as properties of objects when their properties are displayed. This is
        done with built in functions so that they do not block out the user created ones
    </p>
    <p>
        each property has various attributes associated with it: value, writable, enumerable, and configurable. these
        attributes are unable to be changed by assignment, with the exception of value, and thus require special
        functions to control
    </p>
    <p>if a method lacks an important return value, it is suggested to return ‘this’ so that chaining is possible</p>
    <p>be careful of using ‘this’ inside nested functions, as it can cause it to lose its scope</p>
    <p>you can get a reference to a function within an object by simply not including the parenthesis</p>
