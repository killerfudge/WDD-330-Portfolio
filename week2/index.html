        variable declarations are ‘const’ for variables that will not be reassigned, and ‘let’ for variables that will
        be reassigned. Both have block scope
    </p>
    <p>
        initializing a variable without using ‘const’ or ‘let’ will make that variable global, regardless of where it
        is initialized.
    </p>
    <p>
        while variable names may start with _ and $, they are commonly used in popular libraries and thus are suggested
        to not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        you can access a primitive datatype's properties by using brackets, surrounding the property name in quotation
        marks. This functions as the dot operator.
    </p>
    <p>+ works to concatenate strings</p>
    <p>
        use backtick (`) to create a ‘template literal’, essentially a string that allows you to use either form of
        quotation marks within the string without problems, and also allows for JavaScript code to be inserted into the
        string and the result will be displayed. The JavaScript expression is placed inside the curly braces with a $
        character in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        there is a primitive data type called Symbol. it does not have a literal form, so it must be initialized with
        the Symbol() function. It is best to describe what the symbol is inside the ().
    </p>
    <p>the number data type includes both ints and floats</p>
    <p>a number starting with 0x is in hexadecimal notation</p>
    <p>a number starting with 0o (zero and the letter o) is in octal notation</p>
    <p>a number starting with 0b is in binary notation</p>
    <p>JavaScript supports scientific notation, referred to as exponential notation</p>
    <p>exponents can be calculated by using **</p>
    <p>Infinity is a special error to state that a number has gone beyond what the language can handle</p>
    <p>== ignores data type, === does not. the same for != and !==</p>
    <p>initialize arrays in form ‘const name = []’</p>
    <p>
        arrays do not need to have their size declared upon initialization, simply assigning a value to an index will
        create it. essentially, arrays are just a list of variables that can be added to easily. the variables don’t
        even have to share the same type
    </p>
    <p>
        you can use array notation to assign multiple variables at a time, as in [x,y] = [0,1]. this assigns x to 0 and
        y to 1. this can also be used to quickly switch the values in variables by using [x,y] = [y,x]
    </p>
    <p>
        you can manually change the length of an area using .length this can add undefined values at the end, or
        completely remove the indexes after that length
    </p>
    <p>
        sets cannot have duplicated values, attempts to add values that are already included are ignored. Non primitive
        values are always considered unique though
    </p>
    <p>
        including a string as an argument to a set will add each individual letter, with duplicates being ignored.
        Use the add() function to add whole strings.
    </p>
    <p>sets do not have an index like an array.</p>
    <p>
        objects included in a set are retained even if the original object is nullified. WeakSets do not have this
        problem, but can’t be used with primitive data types. However, WeakSets cannot list the values they contain
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript allows functions to work as variables, allowing them to be passed to and from other functions and
        stored in other objects such as arrays
    </p>
    <p>
        there are three ways to define a function. the first is called a named function, and is how other languages
        define them. the second is to assign the function to a variable, which can be used whether the function is named
        or not, but require a ; after the end }. the third is called the arrow function, because it uses the ‘=>’
        symbol, with the parameters before and the body after, though it must be assigned to a variable to be called
        since it never has a name
    </p>
    <p>if a function has been assigned to a variable, then the variable name is used in place of any function name</p>
    <p>
        every function has a variable named arguments, which stores every argument sent to the function when it is
        invoked in an object similar to an array. This can be converted into an array by putting the rest operator (…)
        in front of the last parameter in the declaration
    </p>
    <p>
        default values can be given to parameters by simply assigned the value to the parameter in the function
        definition. default values must always come after any values that do not have a default
    </p>
    <p>arrow functions don’t need the return keyword as long as they are only one line</p>
