    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>
        We should design apps for the least powerful devices to ensure we focus on the fundamental parts of our design.
    </p>
    <p>We need to be aware of all the different kinds and forms of devices that our programs will appear on.</p>
    <p>Start small and scale up</p>
    <p>People don’t always know what they want until it is given to them.</p>
    <p>Make the app’s purpose as obvious as possible as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The more steps it takes to complete an action, the more frustration the user is likely to build.</p>
    <p>
        Keep in mind how people hold their device and design the product to have important interactions where it will
        be easiest to reach.
    </p>
    <p>Don’t assume users will recognize icons just because they are used consistently.</p>
    <p>
        When dealing with large forms, it’s a good idea to split the forms into several pages with a progress indicator.
        Utilize autofill
    </p>
    <p>Find even small ways to simplify what the user needs to do with the program.</p>
