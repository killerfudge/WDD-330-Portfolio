    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>Exceptions are errors that return something</p>
    <p>A stack trace is a sequence of functions that helps to point to where the error occurred.</p>
    <p>warnings are errors that won’t cause the program to crash, but may make it run incorrectly</p>
    <p>runtime errors will cause the JavaScript on the page to stop functioning, but the HTML will still be there</p>
    <p>JavaScript doesn’t always alert the programmer when there is an error, instead failing silently.</p>
    <p>
        strict mode is a mode that catches more errors because it counts things that were previously regarded as simply
        poor coding practices as actual errors. It is activated by simply putting the string ‘use strict’ as the first
        line in the JavaScript file. This can also be done inside each function if the desire is to have it be per
        function instead of for the entire file
    </p>
    <p>linting tools can be used to enforce certain coding practices, useful when working in a group</p>
    <p>
        feature detection is important with JavaScript since it is being updated constantly and browsers support
        different amounts of the specification. This is done by including an if statement that checks to see if the
        feature exists before trying to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        the debugger keyword can be used to create a breakpoint in the code that will allow you to check how things are
        progressing and see the value of the variables in order to ensure the program is working as expected
    </p>
    <p>error objects can be declared by the programmer in order to have them deliver personal error messages</p>
    <p>types of errors: RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError</p>
    <p>
        while you can technically throw anything in JavaScript, it is recommended to only throw exceptions. Either way,
        throwing something will stop the execution of the program unless caught with a try-catch statement
    </p>
    <p>while you certainly can write your own tests, there are testing frameworks that help make the process easier</p>
